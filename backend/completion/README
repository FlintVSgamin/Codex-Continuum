To set it up run
python3 -m venv transformerEnv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

This should enable you to call the completion method using the code shown in subprocessExample.py.
Also, the venv can be given any name, as long as the path in subprocessExample is changed to reflect that.
